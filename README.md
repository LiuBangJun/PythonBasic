# Python Introduction
  1. python is an Interpretive and Object-oriented Language
  2. Website：www.python.org
  3. Guido van Rossum invented the python in 1989 and published it in 1991.(the word 'Python' means 'boa constrictor', it's because the '[龟叔](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%90%89%E5%A4%9A%C2%B7%E8%8C%83%E7%BD%97%E8%8B%8F%E5%A7%86/328361?fromtitle=Guido%20van%20Rossum&fromid=3225314&fr=aladdin)' likes the British TV Series "Monty Python and the Flying Circus")
  4. Python's feature: Readable; Succinct; Object-oriented; Free and Open source；Portability and Cross-platform; Plentiful Library；Scalability(Glue language).
  5. Application Range：Scientific Computing、Artificial intelligence、Web server and Website backend、GUI Develop(Graphical user interface development)、Game development、Mobile devices、Embedded devices、System operation and maintenance、Big Data、Cloud computing...
  6. Python Interpreter:  
      (1) CPython：This Interpreter is using the C Programming language to achieve，it's most commonly used;  
      (2) Jython：This Interpreter is using the Java Programming language to achieve，can directly import the Java libraries;  
      (3) IronPython：This Interpreter is used in the .net platform;  
      (4) PyPy：This Interpreter is using the python Programming language to achieve
  7. The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters  
      Beautiful is better than ugly.  
      Explicit is better than implicit.  
      Simple is better than complex.  
      Complex is better than complicated.  
      Flat is better than nested.  
      Sparse is better than dense.  
      Readability counts.  
      Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
      Although practicality beats purity.  
      Errors should never pass silently.  
      Unless explicitly silenced.  
      In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
      There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  
      Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
      Now is better than never.  
      Although never is often better than *right* now.  
      If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
      If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
      Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
